# ail chatbot

## IMPORTANT
I strongly condemn the act of scraping other's websites. It causes so much trouble to everyone involved and is generally not a great way of obtaining data. Use an API, or ask people about it first.
This was done in this repo for the act of botching. Data are included in the repo so you **do not** have to run the script yourself. The script was published for reference only.

## What
This is a chatbot leveraging `CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01` to carry out demonstrative CS chatbot features.

## Why
This was written for a project to be presented at the 2024 AI Literacy Program conducted by EdUHK.

## When
Since 2024-05-31T12:32:21+08:00.

## Where
EdUHK, the World Wide Web and in various dwellings.

## Quirks
When re-running the formatter script, remove `fortress-` prefix. The LLM hallucinates way too much.
