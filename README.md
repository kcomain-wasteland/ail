# ail chatbot

## IMPORTANT
I strongly condemn the act of scraping other's websites. It causes so much trouble to everyone involved and is generally not a great way of obtaining data. Use an API, or ask people about it first.
This was done in this repo for the act of botching. Data are included in the repo so you **do not** have to run the script yourself. The script was published for reference only.
